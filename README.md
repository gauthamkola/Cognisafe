# CogniSafe: AI-Powered Detection of Online Harms
GDG Solution Challenge 2025

## Overview

CogniSafe effectively addresses the problem statement by providing an AI-powered solution to detect and mitigate harmful online content in real-time. By leveraging Google's Natural Language API and Fact Check Tools API, the extension accurately analyzes webpages for misinformation and negative sentiment, ensuring users get immediate response about unreliable content. Traditional moderation methods struggle with the increasing volume and complexity of online threats, but CogniSafe enhances detection at scale by integrating machine learning and natural language processing. Additionally, the Node.js backend efficiently proxies API requests, enabling seamless and efficient content analysis. This ensures a safer browsing experience, aligning with the objective of using AI-driven solutions to combat harmful content on online platforms.

## Features

- **Real-time Content Analysis**: Evaluates webpage sentiment and credibility instantly.
- **Hate Speech Detection:** Identifies potentially harmful or offensive language.
- **Misinformation Detection**: Checks claims against a database of 1.8M+ verified fact checks.
- **Chrome Extension UI**: Interactive popup to analyze pages manually or automatically.
- **Backend Proxy Server**: Securely routes requests to Google APIs using Node.js and Express.
- **Icon Alerts**: Indicates webpage reliability through visual cues in the extension toolbar.

## Technologies Used

### **Frontend** (Chrome Extension)

- **HTML**: Structures the extension popup UI.
- **CSS**: Styles the popup with responsive design and Google Fonts.
- **JavaScript**: Implements core extension logic.
- **Chrome Extension APIs**:
  - `chrome.tabs`: Monitors and interacts with active webpages.
  - `chrome.scripting`: Extracts and processes page text.
  - `chrome.runtime`: Facilitates communication between scripts.

### **Backend** (Proxy Server)

- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime for efficient API proxying.
- **Express.js**: Lightweight web framework for routing API calls.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making requests to Google APIs.
- **Google APIs**:
  - **Natural Language API**: Analyzes webpage sentiment (-1 to +1 scale).
  - **Fact Check Tools API**: Verifies misinformation claims.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Link

As Cognisafe is a Chrome extension, its core functionality is experienced directly within the user's web browser. The primary way to demonstrate the MVP is through the provided GitHub repository (https://github.com/gauthamkola/Cognisafe.git). By following the installation instructions given, users can load the extension into their Chrome browser and directly interact with its features, observing the sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and misinformation identification capabilities as they browse web pages. The source code within this repository represents the functional MVP of Cognisafe.

## Cognisafe - Setup and Installation
### **Prerequisites**

- **Google Chrome** (latest version)
- **Node.js** (v16+ recommended, tested on v23.10.0)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
